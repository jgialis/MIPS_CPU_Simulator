# MIPS_CPU_Simulator
An implementation of single cycle CPU MIPS and Pipeline.
This is an implementation of a Single Cycle CPU simulator based on the MIPS architecture. You can run the program and type in the name of the text file which contains a series of instructions in machine code (Binary 1's and 0's).
There is also an optimal version to increase the efficiency of the simulator by increasing the throughput through pipelined architecture. If you wish to use that one instead, the process is the same, simply download the files and run the program, and type the name of the .txt file you wish to execute.
